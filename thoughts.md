#Thoughts



* What about management API calls when connecting to a remote node. don;t want to be able/try to switch off mining on a shared node.
* Does Meta mask limit apis that can be called?


* Can the client cache/ store the bootstrap formatting so no connection to a web server is needed

* Deploy contract from Dapp
 * how much does it cost to deploy a contract
 
* what are closures??



there may be different ways to pick up something happening in ethereum

* watch for events triggered from the contract (only for events)
* check the block chain periodically for a thing -> look at doing with promises
